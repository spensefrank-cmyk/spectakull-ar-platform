### 📋 Files Created/Updated
- `src/contexts/SubscriptionContext.tsx` - Complete subscription system overhaul
- `src/app/subscription/page.tsx` - Updated pricing and subscription plans
- `src/components/QRAnalyticsDashboard.tsx` - Comprehensive analytics dashboard
- `src/components/QRCodeCreator.tsx` - Enhanced QR generation with analytics
- `src/components/ProjectDeletionWarning.tsx` - Project deletion warnings
- `src/app/api/checkout/create-session/route.ts` - Updated Stripe integration
- `src/app/ar/[projectId]/page.tsx` - **FIXED**: Server component with generateStaticParams
- `src/app/ar/[projectId]/ARProjectClient.tsx` - **NEW**: Client component for AR functionality
- `next.config.js` - **FIXED**: Removed static export, enabled dynamic deployment
- `README.md` - Complete documentation of new features

### 🔧 Critical Technical Fixes Made
1. **Server/Client Component Separation**:
   - Moved client logic to `ARProjectClient.tsx` with 'use client'
   - Server component in `page.tsx` only handles `generateStaticParams()`
   - Fixed Next.js 15 "use client" + generateStaticParams conflict

2. **Next.js 15 Compatibility**:
   - Fixed async params: `params: Promise<{ projectId: string }>`
   - Removed deprecated `missingSuspenseWithCSRBailout` config option
   - Updated to await params in page component

3. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Removed `output: 'export'` to enable API routes
   - Changed to hybrid SSG + dynamic deployment
   - Netlify config already set for dynamic deployment with Next.js plugin

4. **🔒 Security & Environment Variables**:
   - Fixed incorrect `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` usage in server-side API code
   - Changed to proper `APP_URL` variable for server-side operations
   - Updated documentation to clarify public vs server-side environment variables
   - ✅ **Resolved Netlify security scanner issue**

5. **📦 Dependency Management**:
   - ✅ **Added `react-router-dom` dependency to fix Netlify build error**
   - Build was failing on Netlify due to missing module (worked locally)
   - App still uses Next.js App Router correctly (dependency for compatibility only)
   - Verified local build continues to work after adding dependency
